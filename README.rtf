Project SDM: Graph embedding\

The following files are included in this project: 

- MarcAlicia_SDMproject.pdf: Reaserch + use case implementation
- embedding_neo4j.ipynb: Python notebook file where all the clustering and plofiling analysis was made.

Note that the embedding generation and the clustering was made in Neo4j desktop, therefore we provided the queries in the project pdf.
